/**
This is the fastest way to compile the game with custom scripts without using a plugin system,
since this is a cpp, and I'm not including it anywhere, I can add to this and the compiler will
only compile this new Object file, so basically, its like compiling the dll for the plugin since
it only compiles one file.

So it'll go like, create custom script, add it here, recompile engine library, add engine library to
the exe folder, run exe.
