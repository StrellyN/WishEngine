# Wish Engine

## About

Wish Engine itself is a C++ plugin framework that is in charge of making all the systems communicate with each other, update them in order 
and sending useful messages each frame to, for example, handle input messages, start of a frame, render frame, etc... These messages may or may 
not be used by the systems. 
It's functionality obviously depends on the systems coupled with it and in this case, I'm developing a general purposes 2D game engine using SDL2 
as the multimedia library.

It works on Linux and Windows, I haven't tested it on Mac since I don't have access to one. It's also free software so feel free to do whatever you want with 
the code.

## Documentation

I've created a Wiki for the project for you to have access to everything you need to know about Wish Engine, you'll find the wiki [here](https://github.com/StrellyN/WishEngine/wiki). But if you don't 
want to explore all the pages I'll leave some of the most useful links here so you can jump there without navigating through the wiki.
