# Wish Engine

## About

Here you'll find the code for the old versions of the engine.

The first version is the one with less independent systems and stuff, it's the one I did just to make sure I was able to create a game engine.

In the second version all the systems are more independent and the components are held in the ObjectFactory in a mega array instead of in each 
object to optimize memory a bit.
